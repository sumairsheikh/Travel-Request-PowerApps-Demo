# Travel Request Demo PowerApps

- Platform: PowerApps
- Created By: Muhammad Sumair Sheikh
- Email: sumairsheikh89@gmail.com
- Location: Karachi, Pakistan

## Features
- I have created a simple travel request app using PowerApp and SharePoint as a datasource. 
- This app will also take one level of approval i.e. requestor's manager approval on the request. 
- I am not using Microsoft Flow for taking approval in this app instead I am using PowerApp deep linking approach to send direct link of submitted request in PowerApp to approver.

## Screens
At start of this app you will find links of three screens
 - New Request
    - From this screen, user can submit new travel request
 - Submitted Request
    - From this screen, user can view all his submitted requests
 - Pending Approval
    - From this screen, user can view requests where his approval is required

## Download
- App files and SharePoint lists template files available on GitHub
- You can use PowerShell SharePoint PnP import template script to create lists in your environment

## Credits
Here I would also like to thanks Laura Rogers, Microsoft MVP for the inspiration of this app.
